# Resilience Finance AI

**Resilience Finance AI** is an AI-powered financial health assistant that helps users understand their cash flow, identify financial risk, and build stability without overwhelm.

It analyzes income, expenses, and savings to surface exposure areas, estimate emergency readiness, and generate clear, achievable next steps—enabling users to make responsible spending and saving decisions with confidence.

The system applies a **risk and resilience framework** to personal finance, prioritizing clarity, explainability, and practical action over complex dashboards or speculative advice.
